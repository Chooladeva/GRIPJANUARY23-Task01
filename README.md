# GRIPJANUARY23-Task01
This is a task I completed as part of my internship program at Sparks Foundation.

Task: Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. 
      What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables using Python.
